# guessing_number_game

Hello! This is my 2nd python code!

This is part of my current "mini goals series" where I'll create 10 small python projects to practice what I have learnt.

This mini project is inspired by a youtuber named Mosh from "Python Projects for Beginners â€“ Master Problem-Solving! ðŸš€" The URL for that video: " https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVl_G-F7m8c

How it works

1. Prompt if user "Guess the number between 1-100"
2. If too high, game says "lower!"
3. If too low, game says "higher!"
4. If it is not a digit, game says "invalid input"
5. if correct, "Yay! You guessed it!"

Added features:
1. Guess count
